# buoys-ping

#Project overview

The objective of this project is the development of an underwater localization and communication system. This system takes the form of one or more 
groups of three buoys (GoB), placed on the surface of the water, and one or more acoustic units (AU), immersed under the water. A central unit (CU), 
located on the shore or onboard a boat controls it.

Each of the 4 codes provided corresponds to one of the hardware listed above :

• CU : ___Coast_board.ino___

• Master buoy : ___Master_buoy.ino___

• Slave buoys 1 & 2 : ___Slave_buoy_1.ino___ & ___Slave_buoy_2.ino___
    
The architecture of the system is as follows: ![Screenshot](screenshot.png)
